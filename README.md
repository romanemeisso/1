# what I'm trying to do
I'm using Google Cloud Video Intelligence API to analyze videos for a project. I have a list of videos stored in a bucket that I want to analyze using the shot change detection function from Video Intelligence. I want to create a while loop to iterate through my list of videos. So far, I don't know how to go to the next index of my list at the end of my loop.
